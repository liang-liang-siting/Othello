# Othello Game

## Features

- **Play on an 8x8 board.**
- **Utilizes modules (external classes) to move as much functionality out of the main Processing sketch file as possible.**
- **Begins with 4 tiles in the middle, alternating black and white.**
- **Allows the user to go first, playing the black disk.**
- **If the user attempts to click a square that’s invalid, the game does nothing and keeps it the user’s turn until a valid square is clicked.**
- **If it's the user’s turn and there are no more legal moves, switches back to the computer.**
- **If there are no more legal moves at all, ends the game.**
- **The computer goes next, choosing the “best” square determined by the AI part of the code.**
- **The computer always chooses a legal move and there's a brief pause to create a delay before the computer's move.**
- **If it’s the computer’s turn and there are no legal moves, switches back to the human.**
- **If there are no more legal moves at all, ends the game.**
- **Alternates back and forth, announcing whose turn it is each time.**
- **When there are no more legal moves or the board is full, announces the winner.**
- **Tells the winner how many tiles they’ve got on the screen.**
- **Prompts the user for their name and saves the name and number of tiles in the scores file.**
