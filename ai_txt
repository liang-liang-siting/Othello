1. Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than
just pick a random legal move?
- The algorithm traverse through the board from left to right, and top to bottom, and use the first legal move that it finds.

2. If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
- Yes

3.How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
- The algorithm traverse through the board from left to right, and top to bottom, and use the first legal move that it finds.

4.How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
- My computer program beat me at 80+% of the time.

5.How would you improve it in the future?
- We can improve the algorithm by compute the number of disk that each legal move could flip, and pick the move that would flip the most opponents disks
